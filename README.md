# WP Dev Recipes
We created a collection of "recipes" to make it easier for you to build and maintain your next WordPress project.

* âœ… Each recipe is modular and re-usable that solves one problem, very well
* âœ… We cover many undocumented features inside of WordPress
* âœ… You'll never need to install plugins to solve simple functionality
* âœ… All source code is freely available under the MIT license
* âœ… Every recipe follows modern development practices
Questions, Comments, Ideas?

## Questions, Comments, Ideas?
We want this to be a living, breathing document and have these recipes be usable in as many ways as possible. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, feel free to open a thread on our community.
