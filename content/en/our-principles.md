To help you as a custom WordPres developer find simple to integrate scripts (recipes) you can use to add functionality, beauty, and customization to your custom WordPress theme or plugin. We believe that installing multiple plugins to solve minimal functionality is the *wrong* way to approach adding functionality to WordPress. With a well structured, theme or plugin, most features and functionality can be added to your install and easily managed through custom code. 

We designed each recipe to be easily re-used and integrated into your custom theme or plugin so you can add functionality in a modular way. All source code for the recipes will be freely available for you to integrate and explained in a way that hopefully makes sense.
