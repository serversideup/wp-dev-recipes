# We love WordPress 
We've been working with WordPress for over 14 years and it's definitely one of the most powerful open source projects of our time. We've built everything from small personal blogs, to large scale e-commerce platforms using Woocommerce.

Along the way, we've developed an extremely wide variety of code snippets that are functional, re-usable, and can be imlemented easily into your custom WordPress solution. We've collected all of these snippets, documented and compiled them into recipes, and will be sharing them here.

# Why "WP Dev Recipes"?
We created a collection of "recipes" to make it easier for you to build and maintain your next WordPress project.
