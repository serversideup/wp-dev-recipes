## Overview
By default WordPress only searches posts and pages. However, if you have a WooCommerce platform, it's extremely beneficial to allow users to search for products and product variations if you have them. 

## Step 1: Hook into `pre_get_posts` action
When you hook into the `pre_get_posts` action, you can easily modify the query used during the default WordPress search method. This allows you to adjust it so you can provide `product` and `product_variation` search functionality.

Add the following to an included PHP file in your WordPress theme or plugin:
```php
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'ssu_search_woocommerce_products' );

function ssu_search_woocommerce_products( $query ) {
	if( ! is_admin() && is_search() && $query->is_main_query() ) {
		$query->set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'page', 'product', 'product_variation' ) );
	}
}
```

Before we modify the query, we check to see if 3 checks are true:
1. The search is NOT coming from the admin side `!is_admin()`
2. The query is the search query from a search form `is_search()`
3. The query is the main query used to render the search template page `$query->is_main_query()`

Now we just adjust the post types searched to include `product` post type and `product_variation` post type. You will now get products and product variations in your search results.
